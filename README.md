# Live Coin Watch API Docs

## Getting Started with the API

1. Just open up the [API playground](https://www.livecoinwatch.com/tools/api), and
2. Follow through [the docs](https://lcw-api-docs.github.io) that are generated by this repository.

That's it.

You don't need to read anything in this README further than this point *unless* you would like to help with docs themselves.

## Getting Started with the Docs

These docs are generated by [node-slate](https://node-slate.js.org), which is a port of the wonderful [slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate).

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Node.js**

### Getting Set Up

1. Clone this repository to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/LiveCoinWatch/lcw-api-docs.git`
2. `cd lcw-api-docs`
3. Initialize and start Slate:

```shell
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!

### Commands

Compile documentation to static site in `./build`:

```shell
npm run build
```

Run a dev server that live-reloads at http://localhost:4567:

```shell
npm start
```

Publish your docs to `origin/gh-pages` branch:

```shell
npm run deploy
```

Gulp Task
